# Dynamic Memory Managment (DMM) provides a sys file system to the userspace
# that can be used to plug in/out memory that has been configured as unstable.
# This unstable memory can be in Active or In-Active State.
# Each of which the userspace can request by writing to a sys file.

# ro.dev.dmm = 1; Indicates that DMM is enabled in the Android User Space. This
# property is set in the Android system properties file.

# ro.dev.dmm.dpd.start_address is set when the target has a 2x256Mb memory
# configuration. This is also used to indicate that the target is capable of
# setting EBI-1 to Deep Power Down or Self Refresh.
